## Secure S3 Infrastructure (LocalStack + Terraform)

### Objective
Build a secure-by-default S3 bucket using Terraform and validate it locally with LocalStack,
without using any real AWS resources.

---

### Execution Summary
A secure S3 bucket was implemented as part of the cloud infrastructure engine.
Core security controls were enforced directly in Terraform and validated in a local AWS-like environment.

---

### What Was Implemented
- S3 bucket created using a reusable Terraform module
- Server-side encryption enabled using AES256
- Bucket versioning enabled for data protection
- All public access explicitly blocked
- Integrated with dev environment using LocalStack

---

### Issues Faced & Fixes

**Issue 1: Terraform AWS Provider v6 Breaking Changes**  
- Issue: Terraform plan/apply failed after provider upgrade  
- Root Cause: Deprecated arguments removed or modified in AWS provider v6  
- Fix: Updated Terraform resource definitions as per latest provider documentation  
- Learning: Provider upgrades must always be reviewed for breaking changes before applying

**Issue 2: LocalStack Connection Failure (Port 4566)**  
- Issue: Terraform unable to reach AWS service endpoints  
- Root Cause: LocalStack Docker container was not running  
- Fix: Started LocalStack container and verified service health endpoint  
- Learning: Always confirm LocalStack is running before executing Terraform

---

### Outcome
- Secure S3 bucket provisioned successfully
- All security controls enforced via Terraform code
- Terraform apply completed cleanly in LocalStack

---

### Status
- Secure S3 module complete
- Ready for IAM access control implementation (Day 7)
