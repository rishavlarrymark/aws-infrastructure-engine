# Day 1 — Local Development Foundation

## Objective
Prepare a clean local system for AWS cloud simulation without using real AWS resources.

## Design Principles
- Local-first cloud simulation
- Zero dependency on AWS Free Tier
- Same tooling as real-world cloud engineers

## Tool Verification

### Terraform
```bash
## Tool Verification

All required tools were verified to ensure the local system is ready for cloud simulation.

### Terraform
terraform version  
Verified: Terraform binary available and executable.

### AWS CLI
aws --version  
Verified: AWS CLI installed and accessible.

### awscli-local
awslocal --version  
Verified: LocalStack-compatible AWS CLI wrapper available.

### Docker
docker --version  
docker ps  
Verified: Docker engine running and able to manage containers.

## Outcome
Local system successfully validated for AWS cloud simulation.  
No real AWS account or credentials required.  
Environment ready for Terraform + LocalStack–based workflows.
